## Verification

Command:

```

Output:

```text
▶ AdaptiveContextGovernor
  ✔ leaves low-pressure sessions alone (1.04ms)
  ✔ compacts old tool calls when projected size crosses the 50k threshold (1181.4428ms)
  ✔ adds a light memory brief before higher thresholds (562.3053ms)
  ✔ replaces older history with checkpoint refs at the 60k threshold (81.0857ms)
  ✔ falls back to distilled project state before emergency rebuild (28.5202ms)
  ✔ keeps goal, phase, files, failing test, and next step during emergency rebuild (2.528ms)
  ✔ reports profile budgets and monitor metrics needed for context pressure decisions (0.2659ms)
  ✔ distills stale tool output and deduplicates repeated old context (5.4455ms)
  ✔ collapses repeated stale tool signatures into tiny refs (0.2641ms)
✔ AdaptiveContextGovernor (1863.9015ms)
▶ Phase 32 benchmark harness
  ✔ shows the governor reducing active context versus baseline (554.5138ms)
  ✔ preserves continuity after destructive rebuild (551.5572ms)
  ✔ keeps repeated work risk below baseline (401.9526ms)
✔ Phase 32 benchmark harness (1508.9075ms)
✔ Phase 32 files remain auto-documentable after compaction work (451.1798ms)
✔ captured trace benchmark shows governor token reduction under pressure (1162.191ms)
